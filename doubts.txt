1. why does typetable contain a null type ? - because return type can be NULL ?
2. Is it necessary to have two differnt functions - TInstall and TAppend ?
3. Is it necessary to return the TypeTable again for TAppend ?
4. GAppend and GInstall - required ?
5. While putting arguments into local symbol table - how to check if it is pass by ref or pass by value ?
6. Did we implement functions for interpreter ?
7. Add functions for Type dervations in IDs in expressions and statements
8. check that a function or identifier should not be same as a type
9. what is nodeype do for ?
10. passtype check for NODETYPE_FUNCTION
11. string operations - just ==/ != ??
12. In getFieldBind function
        return getFieldBind(t->ptr1,FLAG_FBIND_VALUE) + fieldRelativeAddress(t->ptr1->type, t->ptr2->name);
        shouldn't that be
        return getFieldBind(t->ptr1,FLAG_FBIND_VALUE) + fieldRelativeAddress(t->ptr1->Ptr2->type, t->ptr2->name);
        or both will give same type
13. In yacc_expl.y
        In field : field dot it grammar,
            The type passed must be type of right hand side tree ? or void ? for assignment and all we check right ?
14. function without arguments can also be there ? - if so, how to identify if the GSymbol entry is a function or variable ?
15. In expl documentation on website - function calls etc are not mentioned ! - check
16. ArgStructHead set to NULL after the LSymbolHead is set to NULL ! -is that ok ?
17. check does argbind set properly as the way it is pushed to stack ? - can't the binding be at time of install?
Things to be done :
18. any heap initialisation to be done ?
19. pass by reference module ? any heap initialisation to be called ?
20. read not working fine
